## Data Model
<img width="697" alt="image" src="https://github.com/thai-tran-le/mist4610/assets/148096037/6e125cf1-c5bd-44e5-8d04-b87965b080d2">
Our team’s data model is based on the different stores Kroger has across the United States. Each store has many relationships with other entities in the table. For example, a store has many transactions, and in those transactions are many items. A store can also make multiple payments to one vendor, and each of those payments would have one invoice. Likewise, a store has many departments, and each of those departments also have relationships with other entities. More specifically, a department can have many inventories, and in each inventory is the quantity of an item (e.g. the Bakery department has cupcakes and cookies, and the quantity of those items are 100 and 50 (respectively)). A department also has many orders, and each order contains many items. Each order is made through one delivery and contains one invoice; however, a vendor can have multiple orders.

## Ten Queries

1. TP_Q1.This query identifies coaches with expired contracts, which is relevant from a managerial perspective for evaluating whether it is needed to renew, replace or renegotiate contracts.

2. This query calculates the average salary for male and female coaches, providing insights for managers to ensure that neither gender is receiving unfair compensation.

3. This query provides information on the average number of goals scored per match for each field. This is valuable to assess team performance and to make decisions on field allocation, especially considering whether or not playing on a certain field gives players an advantage.

5. This query calculates the percentage of players under the age of 25 for each team. This is relevant from a managerial perspective for assessing and managing the youth and experience levels within teams, which can be used to aid in player development strategies and recruitment decisions. It is especially important in evaluating which teams have players with the most years left playing, and therefore which teams will not be changing their player rotation soon.

6. This query provides a list of the medical staff members, their salaries, and the number of matches they've worked (including those who haven't worked any matches). This is relevant from a managerial perspective for evaluating staff performance and workload, and making informed decisions regarding medical staff compensation and assignments.

8. This query lists each team’s name, the number of matches they’ve played, the number of adminstrative staff members they employ, and the average salary for the administrative staff. This is relevant from a manager’s perspective because it allows them to evaluate whether multiple administrative staff members are helpful/necessary, and whether they should be compensated differently depending on the amount of work they do.

10. This query provides a list of team names, player names, and player ages for players who are older than the average player age within their respective teams.
